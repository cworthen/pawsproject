## pawsproject


Completed: February 2017
  
### Summary:

To learn Wordpress development, I created a custom theme for a fictional pet organization called the Pawsproject. I developed the theme from scratch and incorporated custom post types, page templates, functions, pagination, menus, comments and added controls to the Theme Customizer API to tweak theme settings and widgets. I also became familiar with using plugins including Advanced Custom Fields. Advanced Custom Fields is a plugin that creates custom fields and present them in a user-friendly interface for clients.

### Challenges:

I created this theme in a local environment before deploying to a live server. During development, I came across a few solutions that helped me prevent or quickly fix errors messages. Enabling WP_DEBUG and WP_DEBUG_LOG was very helpful because any PHP code errors or warnings will be displayed in a text file.

### What I learned:

I learned how to make content dynamic with PHP, debug errors, and utilize plugins.
